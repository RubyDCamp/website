      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      
      <h2>Front matter</h2>
      
      <p>I am proud to say that, while I have asked repeatedly over the years, I have never heard of a single incident where a participant has harassed another.</p>
      
      <p>Ruby DCamp is and has been an event made up of welcoming, tolerant, compassionate, and loving participants.  DCamp participants have been, for several years now, respectful of one another in our differences.  Instead, we have employed those differences to elevate, educate, and celebrate one another at DCamp.</p>
      
      <p>It is in that same spirit that we now adopt this "Code of Conduct": not as a punitive action but as a measure to protect that which we already have and to signal to all that we are a tolerant and loving community.</p>
      
      <h2>Code</h2>
      
      <p>Ruby DCamp is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.  We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>
      
      <p>If you think your conversation is making another community member uncomfortable, try to make amends and move forward.</p>
      
      <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.  DCamp participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the camp at my, the event organizer's, discretion.  This applies to all participants, sponsors and otherwise.</p>
      
      <p>That said, silliness, mockery, and general irreverence are welcome, expected, and even encouraged so long as they all come from a loving place.</p>
      
      <p>However, should another participant's behavior be injurious to you, we ask three things.</p>
      
      <h3>Give others the benefit of the doubt</h3>
      
      <p>People are generally decent.  It has been my experience, these past several years, that those who attend DCamp are just a cut above in that respect.</p>
      
      <h3>Attempt to address the behavior with other party immediately.</h3>
      
      <p>In the case of intractable situations, we are here to help you (see "Ask for help!" below).  However, this is where we ask participants to try to behave "like grown ups".  It is part of the DCamp ethos: if you have a problem with something, don't wait for someone to fix it but instead try to fix it yourself.</p>
      
      <p>If youâ€™re comfortable doing so let the person know that you found what they said or did inappropriate. Attempt to resolve the situation amicably.  But while you address it yourself, remember to continue to treat the other party with kindness and respect.</p>
      
      <p>If you're uncomfortable approaching the other person...</p>
      
      <h3>Ask for help!</h3>
      
      <p>We're all human.  While life, and DCamp, expects a good deal of self-sufficiency, we are also a community.  If you cannot manage a situation alone, <strong>we are here for you</strong>.</p>
      
      <p>Seek out myself or Eliza Brock (if, for whatever reason, you are uncomfortable coming directly to me).  Eliza will collect the relevant details and can proxy them to me anonymously if desired and/or necessary.</p>
      
      <h2>You are my family</h2>
      
      <p>Yes, in a very real way, this community is my family.  I both love and protect my family.</p>
      
      <p>On the above, you have my word.  If you are not sure what that is worth, I can furnish references.  Yes, I am serious.</p>
